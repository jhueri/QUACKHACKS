The **Pond** is an eCommerce website designed for Stevens students to promote their small businesses and support other students’ ventures on campus. It acts as a marketplace for students to showcase their services or products, and it helps the Stevens community connect and shop locally. Whether you’re a tutor, a creator, or a food vendor, The Pond is here to bring together small businesses from various categories to help them thrive on campus.
