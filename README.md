## üõ†Ô∏è Problem We Solve

Many Stevens students with small businesses currently rely on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, or word of mouth to promote their services and products. While these platforms provide some exposure, they are often limited in reaching the specific community on campus. Additionally, managing a small business using just social media can be challenging without a central place to get discovered by students actively seeking services.

**The Pond** solves this problem by providing a dedicated platform where Stevens students can promote their businesses, get more exposure within the campus community, and easily connect with other students looking for services. By centralizing all small businesses in one place, The Pond makes it easier for students to discover, support, and engage with local businesses, fostering a more connected and supportive campus environment.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
While The Pond is live and functional, there are several potential features we plan to add or improve:

2. **E-commerce AI Chatbot:**  
   Add an AI-powered chatbot to assist users in finding businesses, answering questions, and guiding them through the website.

3. **Form Data Storage:**  
   Store the answers from the business submission form in a database to keep track of requests, manage business approvals, and allow for easier updates and management.

4. **Admin Dashboard:**  
   Create an admin interface where administrators can approve or reject businesses and moderate reviews.
