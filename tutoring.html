          <p class="description" data-full="Hey there! Feel free to come to me with any questions you might have about the course or just about things in general. Whether you're struggling with a coding problem or need some advice on managing your time, I'm here to help however I can. I'm currently in my second year as a Computer Science major, so I can definitely relate to the challenges that come with keeping up with assignments, projects, and everything else. When I'm not diving into code or working on assignments, I enjoy spending time with my family— they keep me grounded and remind me of what really matters. I also love chatting with friends or fellow students, so don't hesitate to reach out if you want to talk about anything, whether it’s tech-related or just some casual conversation.">
